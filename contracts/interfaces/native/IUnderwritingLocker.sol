 * @notice Stake your [**SOLACE**](./../../SOLACE) to receive voting rights, [**SOLACE**](./../../SOLACE) rewards, and more.
 *
 * Locks are ERC721s and can be viewed with [`locks()`](#locks). Each lock has an `amount` of [**SOLACE**](./../../SOLACE) and an `end` timestamp and cannot be transferred or withdrawn from before it unlocks. Locks have a maximum duration of four years.
 *
 * Users can create locks via [`createLock()`](#createlock) or [`createLockSigned()`](#createlocksigned), deposit more [**SOLACE**](./../../SOLACE) into a lock via [`increaseAmount()`](#increaseamount) or [`increaseAmountSigned()`](#increaseamountsigned), extend a lock via [`extendLock()`](#extendlock), and withdraw via [`withdraw()`](#withdraw), [`withdrawInPart()`](#withdrawinpart), or [`withdrawMany()`](#withdrawmany).
 *
 * Users and contracts (eg BondTellers) may deposit on behalf of another user or contract.
 *
 * Any time a lock is updated it will notify the listener contracts (eg StakingRewards).
 *
 * Note that transferring [**SOLACE**](./../../SOLACE) to this contract will not give you any rewards. You should deposit your [**SOLACE**](./../../SOLACE) via [`createLock()`](#createlock) or [`createLockSigned()`](#createlocksigned).
