/**
 * @title Staking Rewards
 * @author solace.fi
 * @notice Rewards users for staking in [`xsLocker`](./../../staking/xsLocker).
 *
 * Deposits and withdrawls are made to [`xsLocker`](./../../staking/xsLocker) and rewards come from `StakingRewards`. All three are paid in [**SOLACE**](./../../SOLACE). `StakingRewards` will be registered as an [`xsListener`](./IxsListener). Any time a lock is updated [`registerLockEvent()`](#registerlockevent) will be called and the staking information of that lock will be updated.
 *
 * Over the course of `startTime` to `endTime`, the farm distributes `rewardPerSecond` [**SOLACE**](./../../SOLACE) to all lock holders split relative to the value of their locks. The base value of a lock is its `amount` of [**SOLACE**](./../../SOLACE). Its multiplier is 2.5x when `end` is 4 years from now, 1x when unlocked, and linearly decreasing between the two. The value of a lock is its base value times its multiplier.
 *
 * Note that transferring [**SOLACE**](./../../SOLACE) to this contract will not give you any rewards. You should deposit your [**SOLACE**](./../../SOLACE) into [`xsLocker`](./../../staking/xsLocker) via `createLock()`.
 *
 * @dev Lock information is stored in [`xsLocker`](./../../staking/xsLocker) and mirrored here for bookkeeping and efficiency. Should that information differ, [`xsLocker`](./../../staking/xsLocker) is the ground truth and this contract will attempt to sync with it.
