 *
 * The total amount of sellable coverage is proportional to the assets in the [**risk backing capital pool**](../Vault). The max cover is split amongst products in a weighting system. Governance can change these weights and with it each product's sellable cover.
 *
 * The minimum capital requirement is proportional to the amount of cover sold to [active policies](../PolicyManager).
 *
 * Solace can use leverage to sell more cover than the available capital. The amount of leverage is stored as [`partialReservesFactor`](#partialreservesfactor) and is settable by governance.
