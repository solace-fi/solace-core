/**
 * @title xSolace Token (xSOLACE)
 * @author solace.fi
 * @notice The vote token of the Solace DAO.
 *
 * xSOLACE is the vote token of the Solace DAO. It masquerades as an ERC20 but cannot be transferred, minted, or burned, and thus has no economic value outside of voting.
 *
 * Balances are calculated based on **Locks** in [`xsLocker`](../xsLocker). The base value of a lock is its `amount` of [**SOLACE**](../SOLACE). Its multiplier is 4x when `end` is 4 years from now, 1x when unlocked, and linearly decreasing between the two. The balance of a lock is its base value times its multiplier.
 *
 * [`balanceOf(user)`](#balanceof) is calculated as the sum of the balances of the user's locks. [`totalSupply()`] is calculated as the sum of the balances of all locks. These functions should not be called on-chain as they are gas intensive.
 *
 * Voting will occur off chain.
 *
 * Note that transferring [**SOLACE**](./SOLACE) to this contract will not give you any **xSOLACE**. You should deposit your [**SOLACE**](./SOLACE) into [`xsLocker`](../xsLocker) via `createLock()`.
