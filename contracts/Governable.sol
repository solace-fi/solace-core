/**
 * @title Governable
 * @author solace.fi
 * @notice Enforces access control for important functions to [**governor**](/docs/user-docs/Governance).
 *
 * Many contracts contain functionality that should only be accessible to a privileged user. The most common access control pattern is [OpenZeppelin's `Ownable`](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/access-control#ownership-and-ownable). We instead use `Governable` with a few key differences:
 * - Transferring the governance role is a two step process. The current governance must [`setGovernance(newGovernance_)`](#setgovernance) then the new governance must [`acceptGovernance()`](#acceptgovernance). This is to safeguard against accidentally setting ownership to the wrong address and locking yourself out of your contract.
 * - `governance` is a constructor argument instead of `msg.sender`. This is especially useful when deploying contracts via a [`SingletonFactory`](./interface/ISingletonFactory)
