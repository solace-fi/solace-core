 * @notice Determines the value of Uniswap V3 LP NFTs.
 * The value of a Uniswap V3 LP NFT is the amount of liquidity provided multiplied by a relative value for the pool.
 * If it was not deposited into a pool that we do not care to incentivize, it's value is zero.
 * We note that there exist more elaborate value metrics such as the tick range of the position.
 * We expect Liquidity Providers to behave rationally thus liquidity is a sufficient metric.
